# SponSkrub
This is a command line utility to strip out in video YouTube advertisements from downloaded YouTube videos, such as those downloaded from [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html). This means that you both don't waste disk space on adverts and don't redistribute adverts. You can also take advantage of youtube-dl's `--exec` option in order to have SponSkrub run automatically after the video downloads.  
You can build it by running `dub build`.
